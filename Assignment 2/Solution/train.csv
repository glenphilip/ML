"executive summary ? the likely outcome of the 16 may elections is a victory by the bc liberal party ( currently holding polls at 70 % ) , a pro - business , right - of - center party led by gordon campbell . ? major changes in british columbia energy policy are likely under a liberal government . ? a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed by us power consumers could force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire ? bc hydro ' s additional generation at williston is likely undeliverable liberal party platform ? income tax cut that would make bc ' s income tax the lowest in canada ? independent audit of the province ' s books amid allegations of ndp mismanagement and incompetence ? review of all crown corporations ( including bc hydro ) to enhance efficiency and management quality ? campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the corporate capital tax , the machinery equipment tax and the corporate income tax . energy agenda according to sources , under the liberal party ' s rule , significant changes in the bc government ' s energy policy could include a move toward the privatization of some bc hydro assets , perhaps including its transmission assets , as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coal - fired production . at the same time , a rate review and attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the province ' s overall energy strategy over the next few years . campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coal - fired production . campbell calls thermal coal , "" an asset that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in bc . "" a high - ranking ndp source believes that campbell will take the province back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new technology . the source expects this to lead to strong protests from environmentalists . "" these are confrontational moves , and people will be on the streets . "" campbell ' s most likely choice for energy minister is richard neufeldt , though we caution that this decision depends on the make - up of the legislature after the election . neufeldt is responsible for the liberal party ' s energy , mining and northern development portfolio . sources speculate that if right - wing liberals are dissatisfied with the party ' s performance after the may election , neufeldt could again defect to the opposition . however , this gives campbell even greater incentive to name neufeldt energy minister , a high - profile position . should the liberals win the election , gordon campbell has indicated that he would return bc hydro to regulation by the bc utilities commission . the bc government has derived $ 5 . 5 billion in revenue from bc hydro since 1991 ( roughly 85 percent of its profit ) . critics say this has undermined the utility ' s ability to pay down approximately $ 7 . 5 billion in debt and invest in the future . this also has left hydro without a rate stabilization fund , something that sources feel may be needed this year . campbell reportedly intends to address these issues , and one can expect this to lead to calls for change . electricity export policy currently the bc utilities commission is demanding more information about bc hydro ' s out - of - province sales . the commission has warned that , given the low snow pack , the utility could be a net importer of power this year . supporting this view , the northwest power planning council , representing bc hydro ' s key trading partners in the us , has said that it would not be able to rely upon british columbia or alberta during peak consumption periods over the next few years , and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses . the combination of a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed to bc hydro by us consumers may force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire . bc hydro privatization a key campaign energy issue for the liberal party is the privatization of bc hydro . campbell has urged greater electricity competition , saying , "" we need to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all , producers and consumers , on an equal and non - discriminatory basis . "" he stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn . "" i want to change that big time , "" he told the canadian institute of energy . campbell also urged more natural gas development , including pipelines and co - generation plants . campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by ndp leader ujjal dosanjh . campbell stated on 25 april , "" we have no intention of selling bc hydro ; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines , no intention of selling their dams , we have no intention of selling their reservoirs . "" liberal party spokesman mike morton also reiterated on 29 april that bc hydro would not be for sale . a high - level ndp source commented that campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding bc hydro , essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams , transmission lines or generating stations , but that he is in favor of opening the sector up to competition . however , local sources believe that some parts of bc hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of bc crown corporations to enhance efficiency . likely sale prospects include bc hydro ' s distribution channels and its energy trading subsidiary , powerex . in addition , gary farrell - collins , the liberal finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister ( after neufeldt ) , has stated that public ownership of bc hydro ' s non - core businesses , such as westech , its systems division , and customer billing , could come under review . bc hydro williston generation current reservoirs levels at bc hydro ' s williston hydro - generation facility are at 2 , 150 ft , which allows bc hydro to drop levels another 35 ft ( 170 gwhs / ft ) under their current permit . the one drawback to this plan ' s additional generation involves the mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease operation if water levels were to fall below 2 , 140 ft . sources close to the minister of mines & energy - elect , richard neufeldt , indicate that levels at williston probably will not be drawn down below mackenzie ' s operational limits due to concern over political backlash .",0

on allison randal wrote do away with automatic morphing attempting to make changes to a class that's already been instantiated is not allowed add method etc will throw an exception this also eliminates the need for remove method remove attribute remove role and remove parent to modify a class that has instantiated objects you must clone it first classobj newclass 'foo' object classobj 'new' newclassobj classobj 'clone' 'exclude methods' pescapenumber newclassobj 'add method' 'bar' pescapenumber objectescapenumber newclassobj 'new' and 'clone' could take an option specifying whether this particular clone will replace the existing class in the namespace disadvantage it eliminates some of the dwimery of the system on the other hand it might make it easier to implement a language that doesn't allow modifications to instantiated classes this is currently my favorite alternative allison i like this one but i also have another alternative first make all class modification code add method remove attribute etc return a pmc whenever one of these methods is called on a class the class is cloned inside the method the change is applied to the clone and the clone is returned the caller doesn't need to know about the cloning and neither do the already existing instances of the original class they get to keep their copy of the original class this approach preserves the current interface and dwimery of the class system while retaining the benefits of alternative since not all languages want to make clones of their classes on modification a problem with alternative it's quite easy for that language's class pmc not to clone itself inside the method and instead return a modified version of itself in this case all instantiated objects would be affected but this would only be used if that's the way that language's class system works classobj newclass 'foo' object classobj 'new' add method returns a clone of the original class with bar added c keeps its reference to the original class classobj classobj 'add method' 'bar' pescapenumber objectescapenumber classobj 'new' the only downside i can think of is the overhead involved in creating a new clone of the class for every change to it for example when many attributes are added at once but i imagine it would be minimal since classes are generally initialized once and that's it if it is a problem we could create a shortcut method that takes a list of attributes to add or something like that alek storm,0

i've never had a problem with any ftp client including ncftp from just typing get then without waiting for it to finish processing that command or even while it's downloading simply type get and it queues them automatically so when is finished it automatically starts getting i'm sure there's a setting somewhere in the config files that will tell it to get them in sequence or simultaneously but i've never fiddled with that and my files always come down one after the other i e you don't have to wait for to be finished before asking for but it will wait until is finished before getting anyway this works for standard ftp as well never used lftp so can't comment the reason this works is because when you type a new command it simply goes into the buffer and the ftp program processes the input buffer after it's finished what it's doing at the moment speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca speech braille uwo ca listinfo speakup,0

pennfuture's e cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market september vol no straight to the source last year when peco energy and unicom merged to form exelon it was big news importantly the merger settlement provided million to fund the development of renewable energy in pennsylvania this year the company's wholesale trading and marketing unit power team presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise signing long term contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in pennsylvania these contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement and are not included in the million earmarked for renewable energy funding now a key force in renewable energy development in the east the power team contracts are essential to bringing mw of generation online from these new wind farms two of which will be operational next month the mw mill run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week and the mw somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week mike freeman the power team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in pennsylvania possible gave us some insight into exelon's renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into america's power grids what's in power team's renewable portfolio we have mw of hydro that is not pumped storage mw of wind mw of landfill methane mw of municipal solid waste mw of wood waste and mw of scrap tires all of the wind is green e certifiable as new resources all of the landfill methane is qualified under green e but only mw is new generation of the hydro all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the low impact hydro standards the msw and tire projects are not qualified under green e but the biomass plant is why is power team developing a renewable portfolio there were two principal reasons a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel emissions and cost was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome i think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business i don't think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases part of the hands off approach was due to i believe a sense that renewable products only meant the re packaging of existing generation not changing the power system in any way over time i think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system for me that's the most important part of our participation to help encourage new development i also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable and that demand for these products could be sustaining will this encourage new development generators get a creditworthy counter party that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location but is also willing to talk about additional new projects over time other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same if this chain of events occurs i think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter just like other energy products now how do renewables fit into power team's overall business strategy we are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio so bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy more specifically we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards but also because of natural demand the average person may not think of it this way but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy i think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements why wind there's no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the peco restructuring and merger settlements under which peco provided funds for new wind projects a second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in and especially the off peak power market beginning in and continuing into this year a third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years and a realization that we need to develop a wide ranging set of answers to meeting the demand including supply side and demand side solutions we felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources what are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal the first is probably the need for a long term contract wind generators typically want to enter into fixed price long term agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period we don't have a problem with long term deals per se although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well we don't want to hold multiple long term agreements and nothing else in my discussions with generators so far there has been some flexibility on contract length in fact our willingness to enter into a long term contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built beyond the long term contract the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investment grade rating exelon generation is rated a by s p so we are a natural counter party for project financing right now there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of credit worthiness that we have will that always will be the case no if we're right about long lasting demand i think other large companies including distribution companies will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects we've teamed up with a retail marketer community energy to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it in the development of conventional generation it is not always necessary to enter into year agreements for a project to get built for example a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a long term basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods and in some cases the financing source may be comfortable with a shorter term agreement for the whole thing is there a financial advantage for wind if one's view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have wind has one key advantage over other resources perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility this helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present it is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term but i am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project outside of significant advances in technology over a long period of time or years i think the probability of fixed price wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite i do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next to years is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio with conventional generation and firm transmission paths a power marketing entity such as power team can bring its resources to the highest markets whether they are hourly daily monthly or longer such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing amount and ultimate sink of expected output the contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to of the time as possible so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesn't match scheduled energy the approach we take on wind generation must be quite different because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy i think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio we're one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a mw wind project into our overall mix how does intermittent generation add complexity a wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows not when you flip the switch on it takes a lot more than i expected to accommodate intermittency even for an experienced organization like ours because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind you don't have the ability to give transmission providers real time information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand in pjm where generators can offer increments of generation on a day ahead or real time basis and receive or pay market clearing prices depending on actual generation wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties an obstacle and we're working with pjm on this right now is that pjm as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than minute notice when self scheduled or must run generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity for purposes of regulating the system pjm then has the ability to tell the self scheduled generator to go ahead and generate or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the real time balance of supply and demand this will not be practical with wind generation we'd literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling pjm every hour to determine what to do in the must run scenario we'd still have to notify pjm of expected output so pjm can regulate the system with other generators either way we'd have to predict output which is a dicey proposition does that make wind generation unreliable not at all we've got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time such as a full year those predictions underlie our contracts but it's another thing to tell the wind when to blow the wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what i've described in pjm a mw system this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about mw of wind generation in the system right now but pjm wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives a certain magnitude of wind generation will cause pjm to change the way it now regulates the system the complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution how can scheduling and other rules better accommodate intermittent resources like wind an alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as negative load instead of generation which is to say when the plant is generating electricity the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating when the plant is not generating the load will increase a tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve in this unique circumstance which of the ancillary services apply to negative load and at what level we're working with pjm on these questions i'm uncertain whether a significant amount of so called negative load will require any kind of real time notice to the transmission provider of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way other countries and the western u s transmission systems have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation and so can we are you working on other approaches another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a real time energy market to a control area that does have such a market the output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis the output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment however notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach will pjm resolve these problems yes pjm is progressive and innovative and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the scheduling imbalance issue it's hard now because we're breaking new ground i expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed how big might your renewable portfolio get will you keep signing more contracts for new projects as long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy we'll continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose long term forward economics support the purchase of energy i'd like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market such as pjm to be able to provide pjm with a more diversified supply curve with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output we need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed we are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on if we execute a contract successfully we'd like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company examples of that are atlantic renewable energy corp and national wind power what are some key developments to make the industry grow faster we need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation financial innovations to allow more risk sharing and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage perhaps most importantly we need consumers to buy the wind energy e cubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other publications authors are available for print or broadcast pennfuture pennfuture org with

june “risky business” until now we have floated merrily along through a pretty placid market there have been minor fluctuations here and there but nothing truly significant but as summertime approaches and hurricane season gets closer you can expect volatility to shoot up it is during this news driven time that people’s fears will spike and our opportunities to profit will increase as well you see any volatile downtrend that approaches gives us opportunities to invest — in the right stocks i’m talking about the stocks that can buck the trend the ones that are set to profit no matter the market keep these winners in your back pocket i’ve carefully chosen a handful of stocks that i believe could be our next great buys now isn’t the time to pounce i’ll repeat it for those of you in the back not paying attention do not buy these stocks now just keep them in your mind so that when the correction comes—and i still have the utmost confidence that it will—you and i can scoop them up for potential profits i am concentrating on the energy sector because that is where we are seeing a very interesting story play out you see back in the oih oil services holders etf made new all time highs—and my subscribers and i called the top of the oil sector shorted a slew of oil stocks rode them down and covered at the lows then we went long when every newsletter writer out there said to run for the hills in the energy sector and we made even more money riding the stocks back up now in the oih has yet again made new all time highs as expected but something has changed from last year to this year what is different this time around well last year my most frequently updated index charts of the oil patch—the oih epx and oog —had the support of the underlying commodities when making new all time highs but this year except for the xrb unleaded gasoline futures index they are making new highs without the commodities did you know that it significantly changes the risk when the very things these indexes track are not going up last year when they made new highs and put in an intermediate term top they at least had some pretty good reasons to go up they had the support of the actual underlying commodities making new highs the media had everyone convinced that hurricanes in the gulf were coming hedge fund managers were so long and strong the commodity that they also contributed to the push higher so again i ask what has changed from then to now the difference is that this time they moved up on unleaded gas alone—and that just isn’t enough to make this dog want to hunt just take a look commodity last year this year ho f heating oil at new highs supporting the move in the oih down from the highs cl f crude oil at new highs supporting the move in the oih down from the highs ng f natural gas at new highs supporting the move in the oih down from the highs xrb f unleaded gas at new highs supporting the move in the oih the only commodity that made new highs as you can see unleaded gas is the only commodity that made new highs—in a stealth rally as expected that just happened to lift the entire sector also as expected but that move is nearly over and the lemmings who follow it are fixing to get smoked i don’t want you to get caught up in this mess there are many stocks out there that are poisonous — they are losers — and will only serve to muck up your portfolio and your wallet stay away for now when i give you the go then you can turn to the stocks that i mentioned above and together we can be on a smooth road to profits—when everyone

my take on how a modified by sa could work follows on friday april am rob robmyers org wrote quoting benj mako hill cc seems to have a taken a position that the license basically stops at the edge of a photograph basically this means that if you don't modify the content of a photograph you can basically do what you want with it under an an sa license of course evan's comments and a few things he didn't say still need to be kept in mind cc have limited sa's copyleft to derivative works this is a reasonable position but doesn't always meets people's expectations or model the existing social contract for use of different kinds of work it is reasonable but it is not the only reasonable way to do sa this is one reason a number of photographs who upload to wikimedia commons prefer the gfdl the gfdl seems to define both texts and images as documents and replace the concept of derivation with the concepts of modification and combination the reason that photographs would work as expected under the gfdl would be because it defines a modified version as any work containing the document or a portion of it either copied verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language but this crucially assumes that an article illustrated by a photo constitutes a work from the discussion of using photography for illustration i'm not sure that it does if it doesn't it might be the case that you can just use the photograph under the gfdl's unmodified copying permission which is how you can use a photo as an illustration under by sa ianal tinla and its related to the reason why larry lessig has analogizing nc clauses and copyleft for software although i personally disagree with lessig's argument in this respect yes i'm very glad that lessig is talking about this and urging a broader discussion though ok here goes rough thoughts so far a modified by sa could work along these lines if you make a derivative of the work you must put by sa on the derivative if you use the work in another work where a copyright arises the work getting the copyright must be by sa and any works also used in the larger work must be compatible with by sa for use in collections and the like this would not attempt to force a by sa license on works used alongside a by sa work in a collection but it would require the collection as a whole to be by sa and it would limit the licenses on works used in the collection to ones which carry a compatible for collections license as a first cut on compatible for collections licneses they would need to be free perhaps the over all work would only need to carry such a license and not by sa itself i don't know how copyrights work on collections if so then since the works used alongside the by sa work and the overall work are not derivatives or would not necessarily be actual derivatives of the by sa work they could be licensed in other ways when not in the presence of hte by sa work in cases where no copyright would arise from putting the by sa work together with other works none of this would apply first have i been clear in the above second have i failed to cover some inportant point s third benefits of such an approach over the current by sa fourth costs of such an approach over the current by sa fifth overall would you prefer such an approach to the current by sa approach rob all the best drew da idea man cc community mailing list cc community lists ibiblio org lists ibiblio org listinfo cc community,0

it should not be difficult to implement days var whichever method we will use but currently we can not do anything until database and hardware are separated for netco and estate after that we can start the implementation regards winston original message from andrews naveen sent friday january pm to port david hayden frank jia winston ramesh ganapathy gossett jeffrey c white stacey w cc brackett debbie r presley mike e subject re bankruptcy and old co i agree it should be simulation and not sqrt when i said is ok i was referring to delta gamma naveen original message from port david sent friday january pm to hayden frank andrews naveen jia winston ramesh ganapathy gossett jeffrey c white stacey w cc brackett debbie r presley mike e subject re bankruptcy and old co i am afraid its simulation please refer to the nike ads for a slogan thanks dp original message from hayden frank sent friday january pm to andrews naveen jia winston port david ramesh ganapathy gossett jeffrey c white stacey w cc brackett debbie r presley mike e subject re bankruptcy and old co i'm not in love with square root of i prefer a simulation if the best idea is the square root multiplication please let it be so i suggest using the up field to saved the result in this way we can start tracking it in database thanks frank original message from andrews naveen sent friday january pm to jia winston port david ramesh ganapathy hayden frank gossett jeffrey c white stacey w cc brackett debbie r presley mike e subject re bankruptcy and old co all the majority of instruments are swaps so that should not be a problem delta gamma is a problem mainly for otm options days is ok and standard for delta gamma it is problematic for times greater than a month or more naveen original message from jia winston sent friday january pm to port david ramesh ganapathy hayden frank gossett jeffrey c white stacey w cc brackett debbie r andrews naveen presley mike e subject re bankruptcy and old co everyone if we do days var then people may challenge our delta gamma methodology with the high volatility of energy market and the long time horizon delta gamma method may not be appropriate anymore as i said before if we don't have too many option deals just multiply square root of for days var to one day var if we do have lot option deals then our current delta gamma approach may not be good either regards winston original message from port david sent friday january am to ramesh ganapathy hayden frank jia winston gossett jeffrey c white stacey w cc brackett debbie r subject re bankruptcy and old co netco if partnered with an ibank will require var over a ten day holding period so this is a change we would need to make anyway original message from ramesh ganapathy sent friday january am to hayden frank jia winston gossett jeffrey c white stacey w cc port david brackett debbie r subject re bankruptcy and old co frank we are going through a very difficult task of splitting hardware software licenses across netco and estate there are massive database transitions in progress and testing scheduled on the new environments on both sides database or program changes at this point are very difficult if nilay can come up with the changes and the impact on existing programs we can see how we can fit these in but right now our priorities are to cleanup data for netco carry out testing for such a condition and make sure all systems function appropriately on estate regards ramesh original message from hayden frank sent friday january am to jia winston gossett jeffrey c white stacey w cc port david brackett debbie r ramesh ganapathy subject bankruptcy and old co it appears that we may start developing a pattern of assuring that our positions curves are correct to the best of knowledge ability either weekly or twice monthly this being the case jeff and stacey please let me if weekly is a correct statement say friday we will need to enhance our daily var calculations with a longer holding period reflecting our best calc time frame in english this means that we need to start measuring var for a day or day holding period pending jeff and stacey feedback what risktrac needs to do regarding this business practice is report var for the longer holding period due to the portfolio having gamma exposures we cannot simply multiply everything by the square root of time i suggest that in the risktrac system we offer another box in addition to the historical var box a box for longer tenor i recognize this requires some alterations but with scaled back business perhaps it won't be extremely difficult additionally this doesn't mean that we stop the daily nightly functions we've been doing since the dawn of time but it does mean that once a week we have a very high confidence that our books reflect our reality the way we understand it bad idea feedback thanks frank,0

when asked about the source of my decorating and design inspirations i recall fabrics and wood i have touched smells i have enjoyed and of course people who have made impressions and places i have been one such person was a woman at least years old who lived in a most unlikely place her antiques store it was from another time and place certainly not from the southwest which is where i happened upon her upon discovering her quaint store i banged the huge door knocker a few times before she slowly opened the door her silver hair was pulled tightly into a bun not unlike i thought at the time katharine hepburn her aura of elegance showed and her face sparkled with a bright smile who was she had she always lived in her store she let me in although it was not the holiday season whispers of light were everywhere high and low the place was packed she had the best and rarest antiques the world had to offer each piece was more polished than the previous she loved living with her things this was apparent after i had made a couple of twists and turns from one room to another she approached and kindly offered tea i declined her invitation after i purchased an unusual bottle of sterling silver and ruby colored crystal we said our good byes she opened the door and i returned to the real world it has been years and i've often thought of this elegant woman and her inviting shop whenever i do i regret not having accepted her invitation for tea the stories she could have told a place that has inspired my decorating sense is a wonderful old inn in upstate new york high tea in the grand salon is replete with scones light cookies and english tea which guests savor as they relax in buttery soft leather chairs which are nestled by a huge stone fireplace i've sat in those chairs for hours at a time watching the other guests always certain they were dressed in victorian ball gowns my husband however assures me they're were wearing blue jeans this grand inn is just one of a thousand places that have inspired my decorating with its unique style and atmosphere i could have sworn it was haunted by kindred spirits i hope so tips by julee tip no cupboards near the kitchen sink install three glass shelves just above the sink or to the side of the window great for drinking glasses tip have a contemporary powder room but prefer country french remove the door to the vanity strip the finish from the cabinet paint in french blue yellow or melon hang a gathered french fabric in place of the door pull one favorite color from the fabric and use for wall paint questions i adore color but my rooms are small what can i do in choosing window coverings lighting and furniture that will ensure my use of color will not make the rooms look smaller a small but effective trick i use is staying monochromatic do not allow a color from the smallest lampshade to the largest window treatment to jump out at you julee i have a small budget to update my bedroom what can i skimp on and what should be an investment invest in the finest rugs art and furniture your budget allows now go and have fun with linens they're always affordable so one can have many different looks and not break the bank even though it's only january i am ready to decorate for spring what do you recommend nothing says spring like flowers and pastel colors choose bedding in a floral pattern like daisies that complements your existing color scheme hang lightweight gauzy window treatments in lace or a sheer material too and arrange a vase or basket of fresh cut flowers the light colors and sunshine will warm any room even in the middle of winter time has run out again i enjoyed receiving all the letters and comments from my devoted readers last year keep them coming in the new one as always

there is nothing wrong with intel the discussion was comparing xescapenumber compatible with arm two different animals that serve two different purposes the xescapenumber architecture is cisc and has more instructions and generally many more transistors and higher clock speed more ram more peripherals and requires a lot of power relative to arm which uses risc less instructions simpler bus architectures lower clock speed usually much less transitors and therefor much lower power and less heat generated the xescapenumber architecture is actually preferrable if you can deal with the power and heat requirements especially for the application compatibility reasons linux on arm works great but you can't expect drivers and therefore many applications to just work at minimal they need to be compiled and in many cases they will not work without re writing drivers there is no isa or pci bus on arm you have abi or eabi or some proprietary bus depending on manufacturer most phones use arm processor in fact arm owns that whole space arm is desireable for small portable devices but in the sub notebook category it still makes sense to use xescapenumber i am working with arm specifically for the low power and low heat benefits but as i said it's a completely different class of applications even if you're not dealing with graphics like x windows there is little source compatibility except where no hardware specific drivers are involved there is no such thing as bios on arm most systems boot from a kernel loaded onto flash with embedded file system and scaled down versions of standard tools for example busybox there is lots to learn and more work to do when developing software setting up a cross platform development toolchain often jtag is required to flash the kernel you're generally much more concerned about memory limitations and other implications of using a smaller scale architecture also intel is a brand name they made strongarm which evolved to x scale also risc and uses the original arm as core with intel specific extensions so using the name intel is only a brand the discussion was xescapenumber versus arm in general xescapenumber is preferrable for anything larger than pda arm for pda and smaller spie speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca speech braille uwo ca listinfo speakup,0

dear sir i am mr sese amman the manager of a prime bank in africa i do not know you and you do not know me but for reasons which will become obvious to you as you read on i obtained your email address from an internet address listing hoping and believing that you will be trustworthy reliable and willing to assist me please sir exercise some patience while you read through my message i have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you on june escapenumberth an engineer consultant contractor with a big and influential multi national oil company and a foreigner here made a time deposit in a bank which i am presently the manager he did not declare any next of kin in his application paper the money is very big and no one knows the source of this money because apparently the time frame of his employment with the company here in africa does indeed preclude such a large amount of money it can be assumed that he brought his money over from his country or previous place of work but that is open to speculation however the point is that he is dead and his employers are not aware of this money and therefore it can be safely assumed that no one will ever come forward to claim this money he died in the total sum inclusive of accrued interests is still sitting in my bank in the dormant account portfolio no one will ever come forward to claim it now or in the future and according to our banking laws after years the money will automatically revert to the government treasury if the account owner is a foreigner and is certified dead but with you a foreigner applying for the transfer of this fund to your nominated account anywhere in the world and all documents backing the transfer legally secured and there is certification that the funds being transferred are from non criminal sources we will have no problems in short this will be a proper and legal money transfer and there will be no related risk we will have to process the initial paperwork to obtain approval from the probate registry ministry of justice and obtain the letter of administration empowering you as sole trustee executor to the deceased estate after which i will use my position and influence in the bank to effect speedy onward transfer of this money from our bank to your nominated account if you therefore agree to be the official beneficiary then please note that you will be required to avail me with a bank account a bank account with zero credit balance is ok your address phone and fax full name and brief background information on you cv as soon as i receive a positive response on your willingness to assist me then i will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about working days the money will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of for me and for you this transaction is guaranteed to success without any problems if you agree to assist me by sending me the above requested information i will give you my complete address including phone fax etc and any further clarifications you may require looking forward to your urgent reply thanks and regards mr sese amman,1

cbs news sts status report posted am by william harwood cbs news space analyst changes and additions sr pulled up insulation blanket on rocket pod assessed sr crew awake updated fd timeline rendezvous timeline tps inspection on tap sr mmt reviews initial inspection results sr shuttle atlantis closes in on space station am update shuttle atlantis closes in on space station the shuttle atlantis is closing in on the international space station today for a long awaited linkup to deliver a new crew member and a million set of solar arrays the new arrays are needed to boost the lab's power and help pave the way for arrival of european and japanese research modules la te this year and early next shuttle commander rick sturckow will fly a standard rendezvous profile app roaching the lab complex from behind and below the terminal phase of the r endezvous procedure begins with a critical rocket firing at p m at that point the shuttle will be trailing the space station by about miles on final approach at a distance of about feet directly below the stati on on an imaginary line known as the r bar sturckow will guide atlantis th rough a slow end over end flip known as a rotational or rendezvous pitch maneuver the rpm maneuver will take about nine minutes to complete three quarters of a degree per second allowing the station crew to photograph the shuttle's belly with video and digital cameras equipped with mm and mm telephoto lenses the idea is to document the condition of the shuttle's fragile heat shield tiles so engineers at the johnson space center can determine if any impact damage might have occurred during launch friday the rpm is one of the most effective post columbia techniques for spotting critical damage that might pose a threat during re entry an ongoing analysis of launch day video and a detailed inspection of the sh uttle nose cap and wing leading edge panels saturday is not yet complete b ut so far there are no indications of any debris impacts from the shuttle' s external tank that might cause problems during re entry the most significant anomaly to this point is a inch by inch triangular section of insulation blanket that somehow got pulled up during launch th e blanket is located on the upper surface of atlantis' left side orbital ma neuvering system rocket pod there's not a great deal of concern over it right now but there's a lot o f work to be done and we'll do that in the coming days john shannon chai rman of nasa's mission management team said saturday temperatures on the upper surfaces of the oms pods reach degrees in places on the nose cap and wing leading edge panels it exceeds degr ees the astronauts inspected the nose cap and reinforced carbon carbon leading edge panels saturday during final approach to the space station today exp edition commander fyodor yurchikhin and flight engineer oleg kotov will photograph the shuttle's belly as sturckow guides the ship through the rpm we'll basically fly up the r bar and then we will look to stop our approac h around feet and we'll do a full degree pivot while the station c rew takes photographs of the underside of the space shuttle atlantis stur ckow said in a nasa interview kotov will snap mm photos while yurchikhin will handle the mm lens the pictures and video will be downlinked later in the day with the r bar pitch maneuver complete sturckow will fly atlantis through a slow quarter loop to a point about feet directly in front of the stat ion with the shuttle's tail pointed toward earth and its open payload bay p ointed toward pressurized mating adapter no on the front of the destiny laboratory module from there flying the shuttle from the aft flight deck sturckow will manually guide atlantis to a precision docking here is a timeline of

will officially become a membe r of the expedition crew sleeping aboard the station while williams joi ns the shuttle crew on past flights rendezvous and docking would have capped a busy day in spa ce but for atlantis' crew docking will kick off an equally busy afternoon of work to pull the pound sescapenumber sescapenumber solar array truss segment from the shuttle's cargo bay so it can be handed off to the station's robot arm and safely parked overnight the sescapenumber starboard segment features a powerful rotary joint that will slo wly rotate the station's right side solar arrays to keep them face on to th e sun the sescapenumber segment includes two telescoping solar blankets that will str etch feet from tip to tip when fully extended tuesday the robotic arm operations will actually start immediately after docking but even prior to us opening the hatches between the space shuttle and the space station shuttle pilot lee archambault said in a nasa interview ri ght after docking pat forrester and myself will go ahead and grapple the pa yload with the space shuttle robotic arm this is about a minute procedu re pat will be flying the arm and i'll be assisting him but it's kind of a tricky procedure in that pat's going to have to reach across the belly of the shuttle payload bay and over the top of the payload and grab it from t he starboard grapple fixture on the payload forrester will have just an inch or so of clearance between sescapenumber sescapenumber and the o bss heat shield inspection boom mounted along the right wall of atlantis' p ayload bay as he is lifting the payload straight up from its perch in the payload bay he will have to jog it slightly to the left to avoid the obss it is a delicate procedure because of the payload's inertia and the need t o avoid any overshoots that could cause it to hit anything a similar maneuver was required last september when the pescapenumber pescapenumber truss segment s were installed i am what we call rescapenumber for the space shuttle arm forrester said in a nasa interview i will reach into the payload bay of the space shuttle and will grapple the sescapenumber sescapenumber truss the grapple fixture is on the sescapenumber portion and rig ht after that the hatches will be opened we escapenumberll say our hellos to everyon e on board station and then we escapenumberll get right back to work and with lee a rchambault as my rescapenumber we will pull the sescapenumber sescapenumber truss out of the bay put it th rough a series of maneuvers and bring it to a point where we can turn it ov er to the computers what we call automated maneuvers and then the compute rs will fly that arm and the truss section attached out to a position where we can hand it off to the space station robotic arm the sescapenumber sescapenumber weighs about pounds very similar to pescapenumber pescapenumber it escapenumbers just a little bit heavier and i think to date this will be the heaviest payload that we escapenumberve delivered to station the folks the trainers in the robotic a rea have simplified things for us and have designed a series of what we wou ld call one axis maneuvers as we bring it out of the bay and then shift it a little bit to the port side of the orbiter to move it away from the new b oom that we carry for inspections then we escapenumberll bring it out a little bit h igher push it back a little do a couple other small maneuvers and then i t escapenumberll be in a position for the computers to fly so actually it escapenumbers a very simple task at that point archambault said i will hurry over to the space station an d then assist suni williams who's one of our space station crew members a nd she will have the space station robotic arm ready to go she will move i n and double grapple if you will the payload with the space station robot ic arm and then once we get the payload grappled with the space station ro botic arm it will now be double grappled and then i'll hurry back over to the space shuttle and then assist pat in ungrappling the space shuttle rob otic arm from the payload and that's where we'll complete our arm operatio ns for that day we'll leave the payload grappled to the space station robo tic arm in that handoff position overnight astronauts jim reilly and danny olivas will spend the night sealed up in th e space station's quest airlock module as part of a new camp out procedur e before a planned spacewalk monday to electrically connect and outfit the new truss segment the airlock's pressure will be lowered from pounds per square inch to psi to help the spacewalkers purge nitrogen from th eir blood and prevent the bends when working in their psi spacesuits a detailed overview of monday's spacewalk will be posted later

raymond since i have not seen any other responses to your e mail i am concerned in item of your email what i think you describe here sounds like nerc's functional model or what came out of the cactf work in that model they said that check out was only between gcas and lcas intermediate cas balancing authorities would not need to know of the wheel throughs however the tp function s from source to sink would need to see the tag to manage their respective transmission assets i hope that what is described here is not nerc's functional model my control area too is not prepared to change check out and accounting procedures suggested in the cactf's work perhaps embedded in the registry tables there are pointer's to from tps to from cas and this is why intermediate cas are optional in oati's tag agent however as you point out there is not a one to one correspondence of tp to ca or vice versa within the wscc i hope that there are experts out there that can answer this item and tell us every thing is going to be all right items seem to touch on a current debate going on in the nerc is and tiswg email forums on extensions of tags from those discussions one thing seems to be clear once a tag reaches its stop hour and that transaction ends it is considered finished or in speak dead it can not be restarted or extended however when where how much an extension be for is still be debated hope the answers come soon seems a bit late in the game to have so much uncertainty out there robert harshbarger puget sound energy oasis trading manager desk cell mailto bharsh puget from raymond vojdani smtp avojdani wapa gov sent monday january pm to interchange scheduling accounting subcommittee isas subject re e tag test procedure hi steve as we approach the impending implementation of e tag we have begun reviewing and studying the new features of the tag services interface as explained at the nerc workshops and as developed by our vendor oati the implementation of the e tag specifications has raised some questions on the section of the tag where the pse creates the physical path for the transaction there are required fields for the generating control area the load control area and the intermediate transmission providers there is not a requirement to document the intermediate control areas there is a location to include them as scheduling entities but those fields are optional this would seem to be a significant obstacle to providing all control areas the information they need to perform hourly schedule checks with their neighboring control areas also in wscc where certain control areas are responsible for managing constrained paths this would be an obstacle in determining scheduled flows across the constrained paths it is possible even likely to create tags where the control area would not see the tag because the transmission used is owned by transmission providers other than the control area was it the intent of the nerc e tag specification to remove intermediate control areas from visibility and approval of the tags once an e tag has been approved and has achieved the implement state it appears to have immortality even when the 'final hour' of the current version of the tag has passed the tag does not appear to be inactive it is available for the creating pse to access and extend by an adjust request this feature could potentially bog our system down with numerous tags that are presently 'inactive' but always available for adjusting did the nerc specifications intend for an implemented tag to eventually become 'inactive' and unavailable for adjustment a related concern to tag adjustment requests under e tag a pse may now create a tag and accomplish ongoing scheduling through the extension of the tag by adjusting oh boy account number scheduling has returned at the nerc e tag training workshop the timing requirement for profile changes wscc is minutes to evaluate any early notice this could be a significant business change the pse can accomplish preschedule functions by requesting tag extensions minutes evaluation time rather than creating new tags hour evaluation time the clear distinction between next day schedules and real time schedules is being lost perhaps the evaluation time of an any profile change request could be linked directly to the impact time of that change request similar to the timing requirements for submission and evaluation of new tag requests considering the above shortcomings especially item it is impossible for us to move toward implementation of e tag for we will not be able to check out the net interchange with our neighboring control areas or be able to manage the constrained paths in our control area please give me a call should you have any question or if you want to discuss this further thanks raymond raymond r vojdani p e transmission scheduling and security manager rocky mountain region western area power administration escapenumberpm isas members attached is a draft test procedure for e tag it was created and approved by a small swat team of isas members and wscc staff please review this draft procedure and provide any comments you may have by mst tuesday

bert gunter wrote frank et al i believe this is a bit too facile cfr part does necessitate a software validation process but this process does not require any for database software and for medical devices particular software rather it requires that those using whatever software demonstrate to the fda's satisfaction that the software does what it's supposed to do appropriately this includes a lot more than assuring say the numerical accuracy of computations i think it also requires demonstration that the data are secure that it is properly transferred from one source to another etc i assume that the statistical validation of r would be relatively simple as r already has an extensive test suite and it would simply be a matter of providing that test suite info a bit more might be required but i don't think it's such a big deal i think wensui liu's characterization of clinical statisticians as having a mentality related to job security is a canard although i work in nonclinical my observation is that clinical statistics is complex and difficult not only because of many challenging statistical issues but also because of the labyrinthian complexities of the regulated and extremely costly environment in which they work it is certainly a job that i could not do that said probably the greatest obstacle to change from sas is neither obstinacy nor ignorance but rather inertia pharmaceutical companies have over the decades made a huge investment in sas infrastructure to support the collection organization analysis and submission of data for clinical trials to convert this to anything else would be a herculean task involving huge expense risk and resources r s plus and much else e g numerous unvalidated data mining software packages are routinely used by clinical statisticians to better understand their data and for exploratory analyses that are used to supplement official analyses e g for trying to justify collection of tissue samples or a pivotal study in a patient subpopulation but it is difficult for me to see how one could make a business case to change clinical trial analysis software infrastructure from sas to s plus spss or anything else what i would love to have is some efficiency estimates for sas macro programming as done in pharma vs using a high level language my bias is that sas macro programming which costs companies more than sas licenses is incredibly inefficient frank disclainmer my opinions only they do not in any way represent the view of my company or its employees bert gunter genentech nonclinical statistics south san francisco ca original message from r help bounces stat math ethz ch mailto r help bounces stat math ethz ch on behalf of frank e harrell jr sent friday june am to giovanni parrinello cc r help stat math ethz ch subject re r r is not a validated software package giovanni parrinello wrote dear all discussing with a statistician of a pharmaceutical company i received this answer about the statistical package that i have planned to use as r is not a validated software package we would like to ask if it would rather be possible for you to use sas spss or another approved statistical software system could someone suggest me a 'polite' answer tia giovanni search the archives and you'll find a lot of responses briefly in my view there are no requirements just some pharma companies that think there are fda is required to accepted all submissions and they get some where only excel was used or minitab and lots more there is a session on this at the upcoming r international users meeting in iowa in august the session will include dicussions of federal regulation compliance for r for those users who feel that such compliance is actually needed frank frank e harrell jr professor and chair school of medicine department of biostatistics vanderbilt university r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch listinfo r help please do read the posting guide r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code,0

network mailing list subject msn the restitution law of unintended consequences to message id org content type text plain charset us ascii forward articles the restitution law of unintended consequenc es the restitution law of unintended consequences opinion marilyn henry fri apr in late the knesset passed israel's first nazi era restitution law the legislation was the work of the parliamentary inquiry committee for the location and restitution of assets of holocaust victims which had been set up by knesset member colette avital after reports that israeli institutions held bank accounts and real estate belonging to jews who perished in the holocaust to ensure that no nazi victims' assets would be overlooked the knesset restitution law broadly defined property to include real estate financial instruments and other movables by default the definition includes artworks ceremonial objects books and artifacts earlier this year an important provision of the law went into effect with unintended consequences thanks to that vague definition of property the provision mandated an independent company to locate the owners or heirs of all assets in israel that had belonged to jews last known to have been in europe in as of january ownership of these holocaust assets belongs to the company which operates under the lengthy name of the hevra for locating and returning assets of those who perished in the holocaust any heirless assets are now to be sold by the company to aid survivors and to assist holocaust memorial and documentation centers having failed to exclude artworks and artifacts from the definition of property in the restitution law the knesset transferred ownership of these assets to the new company a result that avital herself admits was not intended by the law during almost five years of work no one brought up the issue of artworks because the terms of reference of the committee covered only property acquired in israel or bank accounts opened in israel avital said to the best of our knowledge jews in europe did not send their art collections to palestine this however is a specious distinction the underlying basis of restitution laws including the israeli law is very simple european jews owned properties before the holocaust through theft displacement or abandonment caused by the owner's persecution or death jewish properties went unclaimed or became heirless it does not matter how the assets arrived in israel whether they were deposited or purchased by european jews before world war ii or donated to the israel museum or acquired by yad vashem they are all legitimate candidates for restitution the israel museum which received artworks both from donors and from the jewish restitution successor organization the predecessor to the claims conference was astonished to find some of its treasures now owned by the new company and yad vashem could in theory find itself compelled to relinquish artifacts of destroyed jewish communities on the grounds that these pieces of documentary evidence last belonged to jews in europe in such developments clearly call for a revisiting of the restitution law some are already calling on the knesset to amend it to exclude artworks and artifacts inadvertent as it may have been to include artworks within the framework of the new law however it would be a grave mistake indeed it would compound the original one to exclude them by amendment one cannot cherry pick which jewish properties should be restored the state of israel should not imply through its legislation that restitution should be limited to bank accounts and real estate and that cultural properties are off limits it would send the message that holocaust survivors are entitled to recover their bank account but not the painting that hung in their family home instead the knesset should take this opportunity to encourage israeli museums to do what every other museum in the world has been prodded to do by israel and jewish organizations undertake systematic provenance research about their collections with every effort made to find owners or heirs of plundered properties if the knesset amends the new restitution law it should make provisions to retain in museums those holocaust artworks and artifacts whose owners and heirs cannot be identified otherwise we could face an unfortunate irony the knesset mandated independent company may one day take custody of artworks and artifacts in yad vashem and other israeli museums auction the heirless assets and then give back the proceeds to yad vashem and other holocaust memorials marilyn henry is the author of confronting the perpetrators a history of the claims conference vallentine mitchell msn list mailing list msn list te verweg duvel te verweg cgi

the following is an actual question given on university of washington chemistry mid term the answer by one student was so profound that the professor shared it with colleagues via the internet which is of course why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well bonus question is hell exothermic gives off heat or endothermic absorbs heat most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using boyle's law gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed or some variant one student however wrote the following first we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in time so we need to know the rate that souls are moving into hell and the rate they are leaving i think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell it will not leave therefore no souls are leaving as for how many souls are entering hell lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion you will go to hell since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion we can project that all souls go to hell with birth and death rates as they are we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially now we look at the rate of change of the volume in hell because boyle's law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same the volume of hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added this gives two possibilities if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose of course if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over so which is it if we accept the postulate given to me by ms teresa banyan during my freshman year that it will be a cold day in hell before i give you my number and take into account the fact that i still have not succeeded in aquiring her number then cannot be true and thus i am sure that hell is exothermic and will not freeze the student received the only a,0

memo to ensure that you r weekly forecasts are delivered correctly to your inbox please add our ema il address rochelle com to your address book first quarter moon june am est n bsp dear memo p care to hum along it's good for you i' m talking about toning which is simply vocalizing a vowel sound like someone chanting om actually you've been to ning all your life probably without realizing it every time yo u may happen to groan or sigh or laugh or say ahhh or o w produces the sound called toning these are all unconscious re actions and these sounds we produce through the body help remove tens ion and pain and release pent up energy and re establish a natural flow l eaving the body feeling more calm and cleansed when you vocalize a sound memo it creates a vib ration in the body that acts almost like a massage on the bones tissues ce lls and fluids of the body the vibration has a big effect on the neu rological and endocrine systems this is because the hypothalamus and pituitary gland are close to the roof of the mouth and the vibration from t oning acts on them to release chemical hormones throughout the body t his in turn helps with improved immune function increased brain hemisphere balance and stimulates the rest and repair function of the nerv ous system that's a lot of good from just a little sound here's what you do and toning is something that is easy to work into your day you can do it when driving or in the shower or resting at home here's what you can do you'll be using the vowel sounds  a e i o u take a deep breath an d as you exhale start with the a sound as you exhale ch ant the a sound then inhale another deep breath and exha le again chanting the a do this about times for each vo wel you can always increase the number of times you repeat them nbsp after all you may be feeling so good that you don't want to stop happy humming nbsp nb sp until next week nbsp nb sp p s don escapenumbert forget to add rochelle com to your address book we want t o make sure that you receive your weekly forecasts on time nbsp nb sp nbsp enjoy the summer solstice on the escapenumberst when the sun e nters family oriented cancer the early part of the week is really goo d for getting things done  mars and pluto link up helpfully and the fi rst quarter moon on the escapenumbernd enables you to approach other people if you nee d advice help or just a different perspective on the escapenumberrd uranus j oins mercury jupiter neptune and pluto in retrograde motion there i s a sense of slowing down for summer which increases when mars enters tauru s on sunday relaxation will do you a power of good memo memo n bsp june june nb sp font memo i want you to take maximum advantage of the l uck coming your way this week from my calculations friday is g oing to be your lucky day for this period and your lucky numbers are nbsp i hope you'll make the best of the m june escapenumberth for memo it might be wise to listen carefully to what your bo dy is

on mon may james e keenan wrote mark glines wrote think its worth adding a codingstd test for pod coverage no or perhaps no not unless you want to start a big philosophical argument about pod coverage i say this as someone who dissents from the prevailing wisdom about pod coverage as it relates to cpan modules that's because the tests on cpan that purport to rate the kwalitee of the pod coverage of cpan distributions will only credit you if you write your pod in one particular style if you happen to have written pod for one of your distros before that standard was formulated or if you happen to think that style doesn't suit your distro well then you don't get credit and your kwalitee sinks there are distros for which i've written pages of documentation but which fail these kwalitee tests because of the way i structured the head tags i happen to think that some of our coding standards amount to excessive nitpicking and when perl critic is applied to some of the code i maintain the results imho are demonstrably less readable code and that's for stuff we write in relatively well structured languages like perl and pir we write pod in english need i say more finally to add a test for pod coverage is just one more test which will fail often in 'make test' or 'make smoke' and yet say nothing about the quality of parrot in short no ok thanks for the feedback lets see what i can do with it first frankly i don't care about the style of pod in use just that there is some well formedness for me comes down to parsability not style so perl critic can gtfomi and there already is a pod well formedness test t doc pod t so all the codingstd test i'm proposing would do is make sure some pod exists at least for non generated sources in pod capable file formats i feel the same way you do about test pod coverage its the reason i haven't added pod coverage tests to my own distributions it's quite possible to document a module properly without having a separate head tag for each subroutine in it second how do you feel about a codingstd test for this that is not run during make test or make smoke the coding std tests variable in t harness looks to me like a whitelist for which tests to run on non release builds so if this test isn't part of the list then everyone is happy or have i misunderstood that code if you still don't like it i'll drop the subject mark,0

chris why are they removing language that let's us confer with gulf's project management and subcontractors what's to hide remember lack of such information is what led us to this escapenumberth hour problem to begin with reference the information i passed along yesterday these folks do not appear to be familiar with what it takes to manage a fast track project they don't monitor subcontractors performance on a real time basis and or in great enough detail to understand what is really going on and in order to avoid problems rather than find creative ways to manage them it's a black box mentality to construction management and it's risky as i recall their attorney said something like we mange things differently than you might and that's just the way it is sorry if you don't like our style while he was referring to right of way acquisition at that moment i can assure you that their project managers howell sims powell have the same attitude we need to audit construction progress in detail because they will not why don't they want to show us expediting costs we're still liable for all incremental costs if someone other than gulf gets supply jurisdiction right seems to me we're still protecting our interests which haven't been protected very well to date see above how can we not be concerned with our exposure to potential incremental costs if we think it is highly unlikely that anyone other than gulf will prevail in the jurisdictional dispute then maybe we could agree to this in any case without detailed cost tracking we are creating an incremental cost time bomb the only question is whether the regulatory legal processes will set it off pardon the insensitive analogy we need access to the information as requested in order to protected our interests regardless of who is paying to get this project back on track if we can only get one of the items i listed it needs to be direct access to the subcontractors we may not know the costs but we will at least able to make sure construction progress is acceptable and have a feel for construction related risks if we need to give up something to get the agreement signed give up interaction with gulf power project team and or all gulf power project reporting it is very difficult to get a meeting or conference with them anyway their project tracking and reporting are practically non existent and have no substantial value otherwise we wouldn't be in our current predicament not sure if this constitutes comments or a short speech but i hope it helps dave original message from hilgert chris sent tuesday november am to owen david subject fw construction expedition letter dave comments please thanks chris original message from nemec gerald sent mon pm to 'bill katzlaw com' cc hilgert chris subject fw construction expedition letter per our discussion please review and provide comments asap original message from jeffrey stone sent monday november pm to nemec gerald cc hilgert chris mawhowel southernco subject construction expedition letter here are gulf's proposed changes to match the concept discussed earlier this afternoon original message from nemec gerald smtp gerald nemec sent wednesday november am to rab beggslane howell marion w cc hilgert chris owen david alexander james c subject construction expedition letter for your review is the draft construction expedition letter per our discussions monday this e mail is the property of corp and or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient s any review use distribution or disclosure by others is strictly prohibited if you are not the intended recipient or authorized to receive for the recipient please contact the sender or reply to corp at messaging administration and delete all copies of the message this e mail and any attachments hereto are not intended to be an offer or an acceptance and do not create or evidence a binding and enforceable contract between corp or any of its affiliates and the intended recipient or any other party and may not be relied on by anyone as the basis of a contract by estoppel or otherwise thank you file doc doc,0

dear lorenzo thanks for starting a great thread here like others i would like to hear a summary if you make one my institute uses r for internal data processing and analyzing below are some of our reasons and yes cost or lack thereof is not the only one first prior to the rise of r we already had a number of people using splus and our main compute server had licenses for splus as the institution moved from sun unix servers to linux workstations and servers the licensing issue became important having to service many licenses one per workstation and several on the servers is time consuming for overworked it staff furthermore our splus programs that ran routinely on the servers could all be easily made run on r hence this was really a no brainer second r runs on both windows and linux and solaris and macs although the last one is not really an issue for us we have made some user programs that are tailor made for the work we do these we bundle into r packages that then can be used on both windows and linux this was a very important consideration for us third user community even with commercial solutions such as matlab the quality of the user community is very important if we had felt that r did not have an active and responsive community we probably would have been more hesitant needless to say r has an incredibly active community which makes it an attractive environment furthermore other institutions in our field are also adopting r at least in the research departments fourth r is a good choice for many of the things that we do data analysis of varying complexity good graphics maptools working with shapefiles etc it was therefore an obvious candiate for us from the start now r does not have everything we want one thing missing is a decent r dbescapenumber connection for windows the excellent rodbc works fine but odbc support on linux is a hassle the big file issue is there but many of our files are grib which is a format that is generally not supported by anyone furthermore object graphics ala pythons matplotlib and of course matlab is not there but would be very handy however that being said it is easy to make publication print and web quality graphics with r and of course as always with open source if you miss something bad enough why not do it or have it done yourself and add it to the package we have not used r much for large netcdf datasets there are other tools such as the cdo package which also supports grib that are better oriented for this we have used r on solaris linux several different flavours and windows since wescapenumber we currently use it on our primary production servers redhat enterprise edition but we have not used it in a parallel setting we have not used r for making on the fly calculations and graphics for the web although this is clearly possible i hope this helps i have found this thread to be a good one sincerely halldór on lorenzo isella wrote dear all the institute i work for is organizing an internal workshop for high performance computing hpc i am planning to attend it and talk a bit about fluid dynamics but there is also quite a lot of interest devoted to data post processing and management of huge data sets a lot of people are interested in image processing pattern recognition and statistic applied to geography ecology but i would like not to post this on too many lists the final aim of the workshop is understanding hardware requirements and drafting a list of the equipment we would like to buy i think this could be the venue to talk about r as well therefore even if it is not exactly a typical mailing list question i would like to have suggestions about where to collect info about institutions not only academia using r hardware requirements possibly benchmarks r clusters r multiple cpu machines r performance on different hardware finally a list of the advantages for using r over commercial statistical packages the money saving in itself is not a reason good enough and some people are scared by the lack of professional support though this mailing list is simply wonderful kind regards lorenzo isella r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch listinfo r help please do read the posting guide r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code halldór björnsson deildarstj ranns þróun veðursvið veðurstofu íslands halldór bjornsson weatherservice r d icelandic met office r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch listinfo r help please do read the posting guide r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code,0

kristin steven thanks for the reply to answer your questions the assistance you and steven will be giving by going through some contracts will be invaluable we have had several meetings lately with representatives from all sorts of groups but have still not been able to at least minimally define a solid contract this is an absolute necessity for designing and building the validation and reconciliation tools it is actually steve watson not scott that was my mistake he is a contact of ours in toby ellis' group which is gathering power contracts and copying them for us on an ongoing basis including new business the process being followed for this detailed in the attached presentation we have not fully developed a plan for how to handle new business but such a decision is forthcoming as for the number of contracts i am not sure we of course have the paper copies delivered so far which equal letter size boxes with about pages per each contract on top of that there are some contracts being copied at csc totaling about full file drawers although we are not sure yet of the overlap of these with our already on hand copies finally we do have extracts from the rps and csc loadstar and stat systems the csc dump equaled about records which are summarized in the attached excel spreadsheet the rps dump equaled about records but no real analysis of the comprehensiveness of the data has been executed we are working with it and business representatives to garner a more keen understanding of the fields themselves as well as determining what additional ones can be of use to us so as to formulate a final request for rps data dump rest assured that the work is being executed we currently have staff persons on hand already with the preparation of the access db for contract validation today alongside our already available set of contracts there will be plenty of data entry and validation work to do please contact me if there are any other topics you wish to discuss i can be reached by any means as listed below kpmg llp information risk management joshua p galván senior associate louisiana ste houston texas wrk mob jgalvan kpmg original message from albrecht kristin mailto kristin albrecht net sent thursday september am to galvan joshua p cc wilson randy d fisher steven mills scott stokley chris o'neil murray p subject re update power contract validation reconciliation project josh thanks for the update please include steven fisher on all communication related to the project he is leading this project from enron's side just a few questions comments steven is in the process of finalizing necessary fields our plan is to go through a few contracts ourselves to ensure we are not missing anything before you guys ramp up who is scott watson how many contracts do we think we have i may have an ees resource to help track down contracts let's just make sure we have enough contracts work to keep that many people busy i'm doubtful that we do at this point thanks again kristin kristin i just wanted to drop you a line since my last email communication last week to give you a status on our current activities for the power contract validation reconciliation project the access database that will be used for the validation and reconciliation processes is complete our estimate is about days for completion the main issue slowing the development process is that we are still trying to identify all of the required fields for a complete power contract after doing so we will need to go back to the folks working with scott mills to do another rps data extraction toby ellis' group has been working to gather paper contracts from the legal dep't csc and origination so that we have all of the sources necessary for validation and reconciliation as further contracts are generated and or located they are copied and on a daily basis we are to meet with scott watson mid afternoon for ongoing collection leveraging the experiences of the gas project we are currently documenting the processes and procedures that the staff personnel will use to actually execute the validation and reconciliation procedures this should ensure a smooth transition for them i will look for chris' murray's and your recommendations for these at some point by end of week we are currently ramping up the staff involved with this project by week end we should have about staff personnel on board finding a physical location for everyone will be difficult murray o'neil chris stokley and one of the office managers in allen are aware of this need and its urgency and are working with me to arrange the space please let me know if you have any questions about the above i can be reached at any of the numbers locations below thanks kpmg llp information

a colleague has sent you this article from fortune reply to your colleague at janette elbertson most powerful women in business patient but not passive a new kind of leader emerged in our annual ranking of powerful businesswomen she is strong and resolute but not in a hurry patricia sellers mon oct edt for some years ever since women started jockeying for power in the workplace patience has gotten a bad rap after all the virtue fairly reeks of a victorian mission to corset women into the role of submissive wife and mother so women have shunned it instead they have felt the need to make bold pronouncements and rush to action that was never truer than during the season of dot mania when every ceo professed to be leading a revolution and any leader who failed to act quickly was supposed to get trampled by the capitalist vanguard now in these new more tempered times patience may be about to reap its reward in fortune's annual survey of the most powerful women in business we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly we're not talking about women who had the patience to suffer indignities or who sat passively in an out of the way corner rather they stayed with a company steadily building influence there and rose to power through determination and insider knowledge not promises and self promotion these qualities of course serve men as well as women jim collins author of good to great argues that the most successful corporate turnarounds were led by such colorless men as darwin smith at kimberly clark and william allen at boeing through a combination of deep knowledge of the corporation personal humility and will they created enduring greatness it's too early to say whether anne mulcahy no on our list can pull off such a feat but she fits the profile an unpretentious workhorse who never aimed to be ceo she felt ambivalent accepting the title at troubled xerox in july i'm not as famous as carly and i want to keep it that way says mulcahy the famous carly hewlett packard chairman and ceo carleton fiorina is still no on our list as she has been every year since we began publishing the the power in she still heads the biggest company billion in revenues last year run by a woman and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever wall street practically heckled her latest move a bold bet to buy competitor compaq but fiorina remains defiant in difficult times people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny she says as a woman and a daring outspoken one at that her actions are scrutinized more closely than the most driven of men says fiorina i've had a lot of male ceos say to me 'thank god they don't rank us ' pepsico president and cfo indra nooyi no understands the urge to take bold action but she also knows the necessity of holding back there is no question that women who reach the top have to perform at a higher level which is why women tend to push themselves harder than men says nooyi but we have to have the right people around who can say to us 'you're draining the organization you're pushing too hard ' particularly now as the u s prepares for an uncertain kind of war and enters what could be a sustained economic downturn power seems to call for pragmatic and careful leadership this year's power is full of such steady leaders mulcahy nooyi and the other corporate women who are new to the top ten this year mirant's marce fuller no pfizer's karen katen no chevron's pat woertz no and kraft's betsy holden no are all low profile loyalists the combined tenure at their current companies years the six years andrea jung no spent as head of marketing at avon gave her the knowledge to revive the troubled company faster than anyone expected when she became ceo two years ago see it took a lady to save avon as always the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time last year power resided in the technology and internet sectors but that influence was fleeting gone from the list this year hurricane debby hopkins who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ellen hancock who failed at the startup exodus and morgan stanley's mary meeker who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz but one web warrior looks better than ever ebay's meg whitman no on our list whitman who at times took heat for not managing aggressively enough has never overpromised investors instead she has diligently delivered above target profits every single quarter while the economy and its points of power change the definition we use to evaluate power remains the same we consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy her clout inside her company and the arc of her career where she has been and where she is likely to go when appropriate we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no on this year's list she owns a product the oprah winfrey show that generates more than million in annual revenues and reaches million viewers in the u s each week plus millions more in international markets her show and now her magazine o the oprah magazine whose subject is personal empowerment have immense influence on the popular culture from what books people read to what kind of lives they lead the shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers and three returnees from previous years but one trend is especially intriguing women are taking on bigger businesses than ever a few years ago responsibility for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list no more unless she wields media power like martha stewart no this year's fortune includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of billion or more that's a first the ranking has become so competitive in fact that some women moved down even though their power increased example shelly lazarus she heads a healthy business ad giant ogilvy mather where by the way she has worked for years whose revenues grew last year plus she added a prestigious board seat general electric to her resume but in order to make room for newcomers lazarus slides to no from no last year one newcomer is southwest airlines president colleen barrett no loyalty and self knowledge took barrett to corporate heights she never imagined while growing up in tiny bellows falls vt barrett couldn't afford to go to a four year college and had no specific ambition beyond believing she would be the best legal secretary in the world she says barrett started as herb kelleher's secretary in a decade before he quit a texas law practice to launch southwest airlines she made an indelible mark as the startup grew to be america's top performing airline in her job as executive vice president of customers she helped create southwest's famously collegial culture and provided essential structure and discipline to kelleher's grand vision i've never wanted the ceo job says barrett i don't think i have the talents for it i'm a great no person now barrett is exactly where she wants to be loyalty does not mean kowtowing the women on our list push their companies to change and grow and they take personal risks women have to take a lot of risks because there is no natural career progression says mirant ceo marce fuller she should know fuller was getting great marks running international project development for mirant's former parent southern in when her boss asked her to take charge of the company's tiny north american power plant operations after looking closely at the business she told her boss she didn't want the job unless she could do something altogether new build a high tech risk management and marketing organization to complement the expansion of power plants in the u s i told him 'if you don't have this piece you don't have a game plan ' she says it wasn't an easy sell only at the time fuller lobbied southern's board for approval once she got it she built a person energy trading and marketing unit that is expected to generate billion in revenues this year southern a regulated utility spun off mirant last spring so now fuller is her own boss and with mirant sure to be among america's largest companies this year a fortune ceo one of the few the grim news is that there are only six women ceos of fortune companies including fuller and there are fewer women in the pipeline than anyone would have thought years ago when i was i was expecting that by this point we'd be in the fifty fifty range says betsy bernard no ceo of at t consumer the reality though disappointing has motivated bernard to become a catalyst making sure that other women get opportunities bernard and other women emerging now are not based on the old model the shark like linda wachner whose company warnaco crashed into bankruptcy this year or the flamboyant jill barad who was booted from mattel last year says pepsico's indra nooyi pepsico which used to be known for hiring 'pepsi pretty' blond blue eyed males has made an indian woman its president that says a lot about the future of women let's hope nooyi is right meantime if you don't see a new wonder woman in corporate america it doesn't mean she doesn't exist she might be quietly and diligently doing her job colleague at fortune,0

rod smith wr den blue balls updated smith ankle could not finish sunday's game his status for thursday's game against dallas is unclear terance mathis wr atl dont mess updated mathis has by far his best game of the season catching seven passes for yards against green bay he suffered a mild concussion in the game but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at carolina jackie harris te dal free agent updated harris suffered a strained right hamstring during sunday's game against philadelphia he did not return to the contest and is listed as day to day frank sanders wr ari dont mess updated sanders had a huge game against detroit on sunday catching seven passes for yards and a touchdown he injured his hamstring in the game however and is listed as day to day quincy carter qb dal free agent updated carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action ho we ver the cowboys will start ryan leaf for a few more weeks before carter gets his starting job back the team wants to evaluate leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason james jackson rb cle uran man updated jackson told the cleveland plain dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the ravens jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play with the sudden emergence of benjamin gay jackson's fantasy value might drop greatly ryan leaf qb dal free agent updated leaf had another terrible outing this weekend but the dallas morning news is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being however he's no better than waiver wire fodder in fantasy football kevin lockett wr was free agent updated lockett left sunday's game against denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury his status for next week's game against philadelphia is uncertain at this time tony banks qb was free agent updated banks who suffered a concussion during sunday's game against denver told the washington post that there's a definite possibility he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against philadelphia kent graham would start if banks is unable to play but neither qb is an attractive fantasy option against the eagles emmitt smith rb dal team dick updated smith left sunday's game against philadelphia

anderson rushed for only yards on carries against the redskins olandis gary carried the ball times for yards it is apparent anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on fantasy teams and gary will continue to see some work at his expense michael westbrook wr was c dawg's boyz updated westbrook caught nine passes for yards and a td at denver opposing defenses are focusing on rookie rod gardner and westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly jake plummer qb ari really rottens updated plummer threw for yards four tds and was intercepted once by detroit such stellar performances are rare for plummer who may not have a better game this season michael pittman rb ari dont mess updated the awful detroit defense limited pittman to rushing yards on carries don't start pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at rb david sloan te det free agent updated sloan caught two td passes for a total of three yards at arizona if you are desperate for help at te consider sloan who always gets regular looks from charlie batch lamont warren rb det free agent updated warren rushed for yards and a td at arizona and caught passes for yards and a score the lions will continue to feature warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver making him a good fantasy backup for the rest of the year warrick dunn rb tb president taft updated dunn caught passes for yards against the bears but he rushed for only yards and fumbled twice don't count on dunn for consistently good fantasy numbers during the next few weeks he can be explosive but he is also erratic keyshawn johnson wr tb or an ge roughy updated johnson caught passes for yards against the bears but he failed to get in the end zone again don't depend on johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout david terrell wr chi really rottens updated terrell caught one pass for yards at tampa bay the rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most fantasy teams marty booker wr chi luccis losers updated booker caught seven passes for yards and three tds at tampa bay in his third season booker has become a superb fantasy wideout he is a player
